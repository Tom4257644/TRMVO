<h1>TRMVO - Tom's Rental Modeller Version One</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This is a project I started to practice integrating some basic finance into my programming; TRMVO calculates the mortgage payments on any potential rental property and then uses that alongside an estimated rental price and the location of the property to calculate the financials of purchasing the property, it is intended to be used with the time value of money where the user sets a required cost of capital, but for simplicity, this is disabled by default. The main idea here is that most of the landlords in NZ have not studied finance, so this model is not a simple 5-minute Excel sheet but a complicated problem that takes hours. Another main reason I started this project was to practice using KIVY and interacting with a database using Python and MYSQL connectors.
<br />

I have attached a video in the files alongside the code that shows a demonstration of TRMVO being used (Trmvo_demo.mov).
